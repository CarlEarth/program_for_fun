Animation of text output:

The code includes:
breadcrumb.py: Animation module  
example.py: The usage of module make the sentence output look like the computer talking.   

The function, "output.py", can output the sentence in animation.  
If the line is longer than the setting, it also do backspace animation  
and print the remaining words in the next line.  

The content of example is from the movie, "I, Robot", which is recorded by Dr. Lanning.  
It is a important breadcrumb in the story.  
This is one of my favorite moive, so I take it as the name of my module.
