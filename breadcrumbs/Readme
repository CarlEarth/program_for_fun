The code include a function and a example.

The function, "output", can output the sentence in animation.
If the line is longer than the seting, it also do backspce animation
and print the remaining words in the next line.

The example is from the movie, "I, Robot", which is recorded by Dr. Lanning.
It is a important breadcrumb in the story.
This is one of favorite moive, so I take it as the name of the code.
